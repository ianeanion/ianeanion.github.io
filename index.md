### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 1 was one of my favorites because it taught me how to make a simple game using just a few codes. The game was High or Low. I was able to write functions for this pretty easily since the instructions were managable. I feel that this was a simple lesson where I can learn if-statements like where the number was too high, then it would produce an outcome where it would say it was too high.

* Lab 4

    Lab 2, part 1 was one of the labs where it would be useful in the real world. I enjoyed part 1 of lab 2 since it was mainly about converting milliters to cups. I was ale to write functions where it first converted milliters to teaspoons, then tablespoons, then ounces, and then cups. It helped with defining the difference between an integer and a double.

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 with finding the unit price of a pizza based on price and area. It taught me a lot that we can automatically set up a system that would help determine unit price without having ourselves to do the math. This lab brought out the beginnings of using functions like std::cout and std::cin.

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, part 2 was also one of the fun ones since I just had to create string variables and use std::cin to make different variables. It was interesting that it didn't really matter what the variable was. In the end those variables were placed in a multiple sentences, and it just depended whether it would make sense or not.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was the most fun out of all. With creating three times of gradients with three different colors then adding them together to create an animation.  Even though it was first difficult and confusing, the outcome just came right since it produced an animation where the RGB colors had different patterns. 

    I love computer science.
